Project: Build a modular architecture to support experimentation with distributional semantic representations

Domain: Computational Biology/Computational Linguistics

Mentor: Cohen

Description: In the 1950s, linguists began proposing what are called “distributional” models of lexical semantics.  These models use a sort of spatial metaphor for meaning, in which we can describe words as having meanings that are “close to” or “distant from” the meanings of other words.  The meanings themselves consist of a representation of the words with which that word occurs.  In the absence of an efficient way to compute those representations, the field of semantics gravitated towards representations of meaning that are more symbolic and qualitative than they are quantitative.  With the advent of large electronic collections of text and of increased computer processing power, distributional models of lexical semantics have become popular again, and they are one of the most active areas of research in natural language processing today, particularly in a form known as “word embeddings.”

This project involves building an easy-to-use architecture to support experimentation with different approaches to building embeddings.  The goal is to be able to build embeddings based not just on words, but on multi-word expressions (e.g. results in), multi-word terms (e.g. human natural killer cells), and phrases (cell migration and proliferation).  Additionally, the goal includes building embeddings not just with respect to other words, but also with respect to specific kinds of relationships between words, such as between the subject and the object of a sentence.  Your goal will be to build a modular architecture to support experimentation with these different approaches to building distributional semantic representations.

Desired skills:

R
Basic understanding of tools for supporting reproducible research: version control, markup languages, etc.
Software testing
Object-oriented programming
Experimental design
Ability to work very independently

You should expect to begin by reading about:

Lexical semantics
Experimental design in computational sciences
Evaluation in computational sciences
Natural language processing

Miscellaneous comments:  This is a fairly complicated project, combining elements of theoretical linguistics, evaluation and experimental design in machine learning, and software architecture.  The dual goals of designing and implementing a framework to support experimentation on the one hand, and implementing some theoretically abstract components of that architecture at the same time, make this a very ambitious project for a short internship.
