# Internship_NLP_CU

**Project :** Build a tool for linguists to explore linguistic data in order to show the importance of tokenization and analyze the data

**Domain :** Computational Biology/Computational Linguistics

**Mentor :** Kevin Cohen

**Description :** This project has two goals. The first one is to show the importance of tokenization and its impact on the analysis of linguistic data. The second one is to explore the data in the both basic approaches to language, the symbolic one and the statistical one. In order to do that, we built a tool that put together these two goals. To use this tool, use the GitHub repository as described just below.

## GitHub

### Prerequisites

**R version :**  R version 3.5.0 (2018-04-23) <br />

### Installation
You must:
         <ul>
         <li>Download the GitHub repository</li>
         <li>Run the [install_packages.R](https://github.com/ColetteVois/Internship_NLP_CU/blob/master/install_packages.R) file in RStudio</li>
         </ul>
         
### Launch the application
You need to:
         <ul>
        <li>Open the [main.R](https://github.com/ColetteVois/Internship_NLP_CU/blob/master/main.R) file</li>
        <li>Choose the path of the GitHub repository on your computer. You need to change the antislashes ( \ ) in slashes (/) in the path you put.
          This path should be the path before the folder you just downloaded on GitHub. For instance, if the path to the folder "app" in the folder you downloaded on GitHub is "C:/Users/Projet/Internship_NLP_CU/app", then you should put "C:/Users/Projet/Internship_NLP_CU" as my_path.  </li>
        <li>Launch the file in RStudio. In order to do so, select all the code in the file, by clicking four time on the code or doing `ctrl` + `A` , and then do the command `ctrl` + `enter` to launch it.</li>
        <li> To close the application, close the application window and then press `esc` on RStudio. </li>
        </ul>

        
### Use the application

  If you want to know how to use the app, you should read the [guide](https://github.com/ColetteVois/Internship_NLP_CU/blob/master/guide/guide_word.docx).<br />
  If you want to add data and it doesn't work with the current choice, go to the user's [guide](https://github.com/ColetteVois/Internship_NLP_CU/blob/master/guide/guide_word.docx) to see how to add your data.
  
### Small description of the repository
Description:
        <ul>
        <li>[app](https://github.com/ColetteVois/Internship_NLP_CU/tree/master/app): This is where the app is. In it, you will find the ui.R and server.R. These are the function that makes the app, it is the                                    
        front-end. You will also find report.rmd file which is the file that creates the report that you can download in the app</li>
         <li>[backend_analysis](https://github.com/ColetteVois/Internship_NLP_CU/tree/master/backend_analysis): </li>
        </ul>
